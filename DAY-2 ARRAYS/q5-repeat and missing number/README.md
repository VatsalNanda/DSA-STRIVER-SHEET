Q5-#Missing and repeating numbers

Problem Statement
You are given an array of size ‘N’. The elements of the array are in the range from 1 to ‘N’.
Ideally, the array should contain elements from 1 to ‘N’. But due to some miscalculations, there is a number R in the range [1, N] which appears in the array twice and another number M in the range [1, N] which is missing from the array.
Your task is to find the missing number (M) and the repeating number (R).
